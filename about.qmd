Hello! 👋 I am currently studying Computer Science at the University of Tulsa and will graduate May 2025. 
Currently, I am working at the Bank of Oklahoma as an information security intern. 
Outside of school and work, you'll most likely find me spending time with family or friends, watching a supernatural drama TV show, reading up on random X-Men facts, or spoiling my cat.
